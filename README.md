phong shaded sphere with a background that simulates a point lightsource with uniform lightdistribution. the intensitiy of the background color decresases with distance from the lightsource to emphasize the shadows / diffuse reflection on the spheres surface. this is not how the lightsource really affects the calculation of the surface color!
